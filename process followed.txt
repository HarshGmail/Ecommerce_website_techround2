the login should contain 2 types of user, one for seller and one for customer
customer can see products and buy them, so basically he will be viewing all the products in the products database
The seller although will have a restricted view of his products only

there needs to be another database for placing ordres and another for wishlist

so now I have user database, product database, orders database, wishlist database

task 1: complete the login and signup part using the only user data base
status : complete, all databases are working well and login signup are done

task 2: create the product database and an option for the seller to add items
step 1: create a product database and have attributes like name, price and automatically take the username of the seller and store in the database
step 2: to show the products make a table and only show the ones which match the username

task 3: show the customer all the products

task 4: add the wishlist and orders database option

task 5: buy button that will send the details to orders table of the seller

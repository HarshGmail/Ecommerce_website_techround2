Hello sir!!

To run this please download this repository and download flask and flask_sqlalchemy

you can also install using the requirements.txt

once that is done, you can hit the run button

the app will go and you can view it in localhost:5000

you will have to create an account to see the functionality

and there are 2 types of accounts one for SELLER and the other for Buyer

so you will have to create both the accounts

I have made the account creating really easy by putting very less feilds

then you can create 2 accounts and in 2 tabs and see the project working!!
